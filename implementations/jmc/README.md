# Benchmark runs with JSON Model Compiler

JMC is **not** a JSON Schema implementation per se, but implements code generation
for JSON Model which aims at validating JSON data structures.
This benchmark uses json-schema-utils proof-of-concept JSON schema to JSON model
converter to generate models.

## Schema to Model Conversion

The conversion occurs in three phases:

1. the schema is first simplified, especially wrt reference management
2. then if it has a corresponding _official_ model, use it (based on `$id`)
3. otherwise, generate a model in _loose_ mode (which accept any bug-looking oddity)

The automatic translation is not strictly faithfull to schema semantics due to corner case
differences, attempts to fix schema issues (eg typical cases of misplaced keywords
are fixed to reflect the designer intention, which may lead to invalid data reported
from this benchmark point of view) and that it is designed to convert draft-2020-12 schemas,
whereas this benchmark mostly contains older draft-07 schemas.

## Model Compilation

Compilation builds an executable from generated C code mostly with `re2` as a regular
expression engine, with loose numbers.

The compilation time reported includes converting the schema to a model,
generating C source code from the model, and compiling the C code and the (small)
support library to an executable.

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking time is an average over 100 validations of all tests values after
loading them into memory.

Exit status is 0 if all JSON values were validated, 1 otherwise.

## Validation Status

- ansible-meta: 3 issues
  - 105: `dependecies` prop typo because of fixed `additionalProperties`
  - 201/312: `argument_specs` prop because of fixed `additionalProperties`
- cspell:
  - 2 regular expressions uselessly re extensions incompatible with re2
- lazygit: one issue
  - 47: obscure issue with utf8 string length, `bmstowcs` returns _-1_
- openapi: one issue
  - 26: `"<local-terminal-IP-address>"` is not really a valid URI reference
  - NOTE: beware that the provided schema does _not_ validate schemasâ€¦
  - NOTE: it seems that formats are _not_ validated by any tools
- ui5-manifest:
  - one regular expressions extension incompatible with re2
- yamllint: 18 issues
  - the 18 differences are raw strings, model conversion rightfully infer object requirement
    thus reject strings like "hello world" as valid yamllint values
